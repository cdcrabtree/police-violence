[Mapping Police Violence](http://mappingpoliceviolence.org/) just released [their 2015 Police Violence Report](http://mappingpoliceviolence.org/2015/), along with the data supporting it. 

One of the most stunning conclusions of the original report is the finding that community violence does not predict police violence. This disproves a common narrative that police are simply responding to violence in kind, and suggests that department policy plays a role in police behavior.

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

mpvData <- read_excel("MPVDatasetDownload-83zj.xlsx", sheet = 1)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
