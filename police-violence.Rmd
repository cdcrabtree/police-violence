[Mapping Police Violence](http://mappingpoliceviolence.org/) just released [their 2015 Police Violence Report](http://mappingpoliceviolence.org/2015/), along with the data supporting it. 

One of the most stunning conclusions of the original report is the finding that community violence does not predict police violence. This disproves a common narrative that police are simply responding to violence in kind, and suggests that department policy plays a role in police behavior. 

Here I take a stab at recreating the graph that accompanies the report. It plots community and police violence in the figure, with separate Y-axes for the factors.

mpvReport <- read_excel("MPVDatasetDownload-83zj.xlsx", sheet = 2) 

mpvReport <- mpvReport %>%
  mutate(`Police Department` = sub("^[^[:alpha:]]*", "", `Police Department`),
         row_number = 1:nrow(.)) %>% 
  filter(row_number <= 60)

p1 <- ggplot(mpvReport, aes(x = row_number, 
                            y = `Rate of Police Killings per Million Population`)) +
